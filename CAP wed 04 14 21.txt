interview question 
===================================
define the difference between security and complians 
security -- measures you put in place to protect your system .. ie tools, technology.
compliance -- frameworks or guidelines you follow such as nist, iso -27001, feddramp




what are controls ?
================================

They are countermeasures ;
 
The federal gov uses nIST 800-53 rev4 | rev5 ==> this is guide where controls are located.
There are 18 controls ==> out of the 18 we have technical, operational and management controls 

There are 4 techinical controls 
9 Operationals 
Management conrols 

the short form is called TOM495


===========================================
The 18 controls include ;

AC, IA, SC , SI , IR , CM , CP, AU, PS, PE, PM, AT, PL, RA, MA, MP, SA, CA, 



Interview queston 
=====================
which controls are more difficult 
which controls have you worked with ?
which controls have you implimented


+================================
select  controls to talk about 
tech controls ac, ia
2 management = planning, AS
4 operational controls ps, ma, ir, 

========================================================================

Under the above controls we have sub families for e,g AC has about 25 sub family controls 
check Talatek app 



account management 
==============================
roles and groups and grant and revoked as necessary 
ac 6 
ac 8 
reminds you the last time  tou logged in to make sure no one else logged
ac 11 session log.. terminate inactive sessions 

awareness an training -- you must train people to be aware ( things like phishing 

============================================================

rule based training -- train users accordinig to their job functions 
keep reccords to show that you are in compliance 

audit and accountability
====================================
e.g splunk minitors logs to see what all user activity 
logs record all activity and inforamtion 
all system should be audited so avoid suspicious access
The logs must all have timestamps 

configuration management 
===========================
baseline configuration to harden to secure system 
change mamagement -- all changes approved 

identiy impact for changes made 

restrict access to changes ie users cant just download 

least functionality -- ie only have the functions they need for their jobs e,g restriction downloads 

emergency 
================================
cp -4 
cp -7 alternate site locations just incase one goes done
cp -8 have muiltple telecomm services 
cp -9 inforation sstem backup --- 


identifiaction and authentication 
================================
IA-7 

incident response 
=======================
an incident is a malicious event
know how to managemnt 


maintenance 
==============================
frequent checks of servers , network , hvac etc and keep doc to show 

media protection
=================================
hard drives 
when hard drives are full how long do you keep them for, how do yo store them, how to do sanitize them( getting rid or destryouii)

physcial access and env protection
=========================
physcial access contorol-- security gaurds , logs , cameras, 
access to output devices - printters, monitor
monitor visitor access -- ID verification ( scan and badge handed ). Log out visitor and keep record 


pe -11 emergency power --- backup generator
pe -13 fire sprinklers 
pe -14 temp and humidity controls
pe -15 - water damage and protection-- server rooms have raised floors to prevent flood damage

pe -16 delivery


personal security 
===============================
ps -3 personal screening
ps-4 personal termination 


SC
==============================
sc -7 boundary protecttion -- firewall


SI 
===========================
flaw remediaton -- fixing malwares 


REMediation 
==========================================
It sis a strategy or plan to fix or mitigate a vulnerability 

Mitigation 
=====================================
Is an action to fix a vulnerability 

if ou find a weakness you have to come up with a remediation plan to mitigate the vulnerability .

Icident 
========================================
this is any adverse effect that took plac eon your system or technology 

Check week one notes ****


There are different types of control 
=========================================================================

1) deterrent control -- used to discourage a potential attacker cameras,alarm systems, motion detectors  honeypot( fake system ie decoy system acreated by agency , to see how hackers can break it . they then use this info the harden the actual system ), 

2) preventive controls prevent incident from occuring such as intrusion prevention systems  ie firewalls( first defence line to prevent an attachk ) , anti virus (against malware )
3) corrective control e.g patches correct bugs, training , harden the system, 

4) recovery controls -- backups that can be used to recover, contigency planning, DR

5)  detective controls -- intrusion detection systems(IDS) , splunk , Log review ( usning splunk), alarm system 

6) compensative controls -- ultimate controls that are used to reduce the risk of another control not in place ..e,g security guards, alarm,cameras, fence, motion detector thus if one fails the other compensates 




Meaning and Types of security 
our job is to preotect info systems...

Interview question
=======================================================

what type of systm hacve you supported as an analyst, ISSO and an assessor?

 have uspported systems like applications such as:
oracle financial,
pple soft, 
scout, 
workday, 
identity and assess management systems(IAM), 
cloud systems(aws, azure, google), infra or GSS( general support systems)
office 365 systems (SAAS),sharepoint,
asset management systems 
payroll systems such as ADP
Internal health systems 
Benefits system- insurance 
401k systems 

CIO, CISO --chied info sec officcer
DC --dicrotor of complaince 
SO --system owner 
ISSM -- info system manager 
ISSO --info sec officer 
IA-- info assurance/cyber analyst 
SC -- security assessor
SOC- sec operations analyst ( monitor network traffic 24/7 .. IDS/IPS/firewall(  pen tester,vul analyst,splunk)
AO-- authorization official --- grants access to operate


CA and A&A

A&A asseement and auth is same as risk management framework.(RMF)
The guideline for A&A is Nist 800-37 rev 2
act is called FISMA( fed info sec modernation act) This is a legislature that has been passed in law and signed by the president 
passed as a law passed by gov 

The used dept of commerce --making it responsible to enforced this act 
Dept of commerce created NIST( national insti of )nist dev guide to help all agencies efforce guide  and FIP

Nist created special  guideline 800-37 to enforce the RMF which says every system and agency being built must to thru the RMF system and authorized by someone the (AO)which then provides an ATO( authorization to operate)


A&A has six steps the new one has 7steps 

if working for the gov you have to do the 7 steps 
analyst does all 6 steps 
assessor does 7 steps 




why chnage ? cus of lack of reburst and continous monitoring
